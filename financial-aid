 I’m a student from Sri Lanka and want to Machine Learning. I think it will be beneficial for me to get into ml field and would be help full for my final year research. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expanses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship. In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. Receiving this Financial Aid will open for me new horizons of the world of Coursera courses, which in turn will help me in future. I can't ask my dad for the money has he already struggles to support my family. I don't want to strain him by asking money for this certification. If I get a certificate fro this course it would be help full for me to reach higher heights in my career as a student also after graduation.
 
 I want to take this course as I want to learn machine learning. I want to complete the course due to my curiosity and also that I can put a good CV to get applied to a job. This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in carrying out various programs in a computer language and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer-reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
